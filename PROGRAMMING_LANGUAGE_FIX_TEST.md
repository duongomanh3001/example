# Test Script for Programming Language Fix
echo "=== Testing Programming Language Detection and Submission Fix ==="

# Test case demonstrating the fix
cat << 'EOF'

## Before Fix:
❌ Problem: Student submits Python code but database saves as 'java'

Database record example:
```
programming_language: 'java'
code: 'def countCharacter_teacher(s: str, key: str) -> int:
    count = 0
    for ch in s:
        if ch == key:
            count += 1
    return count'
```

## After Fix:

### 1. Enhanced Language Detection in Frontend
- Improved regex patterns to detect Python type hints (`: str`, `: int`)  
- Added detection for Python function definitions with regex `/def\s+\w+\s*\(/`
- Better fallback logic for edge cases

### 2. Fixed Backend Question Service  
- QuestionService.createQuestion() now saves `programmingLanguage` field
- StudentDashboardService uses actual question language instead of hardcoded 'java'
- Enhanced grading fields properly mapped from CreateQuestionRequest

### 3. Fixed Frontend Question Creation
- Teacher assignment creation now includes `programmingLanguage` in submission
- Enhanced grading fields (functionName, functionSignature, etc.) properly sent

## Test Results:

✅ Python code detection:
```javascript
// Before: 'def countCharacter_teacher(s: str, key: str)' → detected as 'C' → fallback to 'java'
// After: 'def countCharacter_teacher(s: str, key: str)' → detected as 'PYTHON'
```

✅ Database storage:
```sql
-- After fix:
programming_language: 'python'  -- ✅ Correct
code: 'def countCharacter_teacher(s: str, key: str) -> int:...'
```

✅ Student workflow:
1. Teacher creates question with Python language selected ✅
2. Student receives question with correct language info ✅  
3. Student submits Python code ✅
4. System detects and saves as 'python' not 'java' ✅
5. Auto-grading uses correct Python wrapper ✅

## Files Modified:

1. **Frontend Language Detection**: `/attempt/page.tsx`
   - Enhanced regex patterns for Python detection
   - Better fallback logic

2. **Backend Question Service**: `QuestionService.java`  
   - Added programmingLanguage field mapping
   - Enhanced grading fields support

3. **Student Dashboard Service**: `StudentDashboardService.java`
   - Removed hardcoded 'java' defaults
   - Use actual question programmingLanguage

4. **Teacher Question Creation**: `/create/page.tsx`
   - Include programmingLanguage in submission
   - Enhanced grading fields support

## Usage Example:

### Teacher creates Python question:
1. Select "Programming Question" type
2. Choose "Python" from language dropdown  
3. Add answer code: `def countCharacter(s, key): ...`
4. Create test cases with Python syntax
5. Save assignment

### Student submits:
1. Receives question with Python language indicator
2. Writes Python code following the pattern  
3. Submits code
4. ✅ Database correctly stores programming_language: 'python'
5. ✅ Auto-grading uses Python wrapper and execution
